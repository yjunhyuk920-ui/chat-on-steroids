/**
 * The local bridge between the Chrome extension and this app.
 *
 * A second loopback server, separate from the MCP endpoint, because the two have
 * opposite requirements: the MCP endpoint refuses any browser origin on purpose,
 * while this one exists to be called by a browser extension.
 *
 * What keeps it safe:
 *   · 127.0.0.1 only, never 0.0.0.0
 *   · the only unauthenticated routes are /hello (a fixed identifying string) and
 *     /pair, which issues the token to a caller on 127.0.0.1 — see the route for what
 *     that deliberately does and does not buy
 *   · every other route needs the bearer token issued by /pair, compared in
 *     constant time, and stored encrypted rather than in config.json
 *   · the Origin must be a chrome-extension:// origin, so a web page cannot drive it
 *   · bodies are capped and requests are rate limited
 *
 * It is deliberately not a general control API. It accepts observations about a
 * ChatGPT conversation and hands back activity summaries and queued commands. It
 * cannot read a file, run anything, or change a permission.
