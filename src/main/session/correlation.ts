/**
 * The single ownership join between ChatGPT's page model and an inbound MCP request.
 *
 * ChatGPT puts one opaque request id in both places:
 *   - HTTP `x-request-id` on the MCP request (normalised at ingress), and
 *   - `message.metadata.request_id` on the connector request in the page model.
 *
 * Nothing else is ownership evidence. In particular, tool names, timestamps, rendered
 * connector rows, the active tab and "the only chat generating" never enter this registry.
 *
 * Once that exact join has been proved, ownership is durable. `request_id` names one ChatGPT
 * workflow, and the MCP side may keep issuing calls after the page that originally exposed the
 * id has been reloaded, compacted or closed. Expiring the join after ten minutes was the live
 * 1.8.1 bug: the same still-running request went from correctly attributed to Unattributed
 * solely because its browser evidence aged out. A proven owner therefore has no time TTL.
