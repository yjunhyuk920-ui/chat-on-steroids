/**
 * The multi-agent broker.
 *
 * Experimental and disabled by default. One ChatGPT conversation is the prime agent; it
 * spawns workers, each of which is a separate ChatGPT tab the extension opens. All state
 * lives here, in this app: the browser only opens tabs and types the first message.
 *
 * ## One active run; durable history per prime conversation
 *
 * There is at most one *executing* run at a time. That is the global capacity claim: while any
 * worker is invited, active, detached or waking, another prime cannot start workers. Ownership
 * lasts longer. When the final slot-holder stops, the active incarnation is parked immediately
 * and its entire agent map becomes dormant history keyed by the exact prime conversation. That
 * history holds no global slot, so another chat may run its own workers while the original prime
 * still sees every worker it ever created and may later wake the reusable ones in their exact
 * old ChatGPT conversations once the global execution claim is free.
 *
 * A prime is established only by a successful `spawn` from a conversation this app proved made
 * the call. Its ownership key moves only through the app's authenticated Compact & Resume
 * transaction, including recovery of a durable A→B session move. Nothing infers a prime,
 * promotes one or takes one over.
 *
 * That makes every other question a lookup rather than a guess:
 *
 *   · a call from the active `primeConversationId` is that run's prime;
 *   · a call from a dormant owner may inspect only that owner's history;
 *   · a call from an active worker's bound conversation is that worker;
 *   · a dormant worker conversation remains worker-owned identity but cannot act until its own
 *     prime explicitly wakes it;
 *   · every other conversation is a stranger, and while another run exists it is told
 *     `AGENTS_BUSY` and nothing else — never another prime's history.
 *
 * ## Why spawn is atomic
 *
 * `spawn` used to create workers and then work out who the prime was, which is how a chat
 * that was not the prime ended up owning worker chats. Here the order is fixed and every
 * step that can fail happens before the first mutation: prove the caller's conversation →
 * check it is not a worker → check no other run holds the execution claim → reactivate this
 * prime's own dormant history or create a new owner → create workers. The staged durability
 * boundary can roll a reactivated history back to dormant without losing its old workers.
 *
 * ## Why nobody holds a credential
 *
 * Every agent here is identified by *where it is*, and only by that. The prime is the
 * conversation the user is sitting in; a worker is the conversation this app opened for its
 * slot and watched itself open. Making a model carry a bearer secret through every tool call
 * put a routing token in the transcript for roles that a conversation id already names, and
 * a token the model has to remember is a token it can forget, paste into the wrong chat, or
 * have stripped by ChatGPT's own harness.
 *
 * ## A worker is a worker before it speaks
 *
 * The lifecycle transition is the app's, not the model's. The extension opens the tab, learns
 * its exact `/c/<id>`, and reports it; {@link bindConversation} binds *and activates* the slot
 * in one step, before the model in that chat has said anything. So the first user message in
 * a worker chat is the task itself — there is no handshake to perform, no key to quote, and
 * nothing a worker has to do before it can start working.
 *
 * ## Workers sleep; they do not end
 *
 * A worker used to be one job in one throwaway chat. It reported, its slot became a
 * tombstone, and more work meant another `spawn` — another conversation, discarded again
 * minutes later. That is exactly the pattern ChatGPT itself pushes back on, and it threw away
 * the most valuable thing the run had: a chat that already understood the task.
 *
 * So the end of a worker's *turn* is not the end of the worker. It goes to `sleeping` in the
 * chat it already has, keeping its conversation, its transcript, its workspace and its inbox,
 * and it releases its slot while it is there. `agents action=message` to a sleeping worker is
 * a revival: the broker reserves a slot, the app reopens that exact `/c/<id>`, and the
 * extension types the prime's message into it as an ordinary user message. None of that needs
 * the tab to still be open, and none of it needs the model to remember anything.
 *
 * Three things put a worker to sleep, and they are all the app's observations rather than the
 * model's assertions: an explicit `agents action=finish`, a settled final assistant answer in
 * its chat, and silence long enough that no turn can still be running. Waking is symmetric —
 * a revival the prime asked for, or a proven tool call from a worker that turned out not to
 * have been asleep after all.
 *
 * The one thing that is genuinely terminal is the worker's own context. Past
 * {@link WORKER_CONTEXT_CEILING_TOKENS} there is nothing left to reuse, so the next time that
 * worker stops working it stops for good. Crossing the ceiling never *stops* a worker
 * mid-task: it only decides what the end of that task means.

 * a slot that was closed underneath a turn which never stopped.
