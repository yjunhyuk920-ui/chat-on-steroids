/**
 * The Core connector: reading, changing and running code on this PC.
 *
 * Seven tools at the absolute maximum, and usually five. That number is the design (see
 * `docs/tool-surface.md` §3): a no-query discovery pull against this connector returns
 * every schema here at once, so the surface is sized for the worst case rather than for
 * the case where the harness happens to ask a narrow question.
 *
 * What used to be forty-five tools did not become seven by dropping capability. It became
 * seven by separating *primitives* from *procedures*: `exec_command` can run git, so `git`
 * is a skill rather than a tool; `read` can open a directory, a text file or an image,
 * because those are three shapes of one question. Anything that reads as "and also, for
 * this special case…" belongs in a skill over these primitives, not in a schema every
 * conversation pays for.

/**
 * One tool, four actions, registered only while multi-agent mode is on. Fresh installs enable
 * it; existing configs keep their stored choice, so a user who has it off never sees this schema.
 *
 * The identity model is the whole design, and it is the same one for every role: an agent *is*
 * the ChatGPT conversation it runs in. A chat becomes the prime by spawning from its own proven
 * conversation; a worker is the chat the app opened for its slot, bound and activated by the
 * extension's report before the model there reads its task. Neither is anything the model can
 * assert, so there is no key to carry, no takeover, no promotion and no inference — a call this
 * app cannot place is refused rather than guessed at, and a chat that is not in the run learns
 * only that a run exists.
 *
 * There is no `join`, and no key field anywhere in this schema. There used to be one manual
 * recovery action for the case where the extension's binding report was lost: it was a second
 * way to become a worker, it was the only thing in the app that put a credential into a model's
 * hands, and a run whose binding report never arrived is better restarted than repaired.
 *
 * Every result here also carries `structuredContent`. The text half is what the model should
 * act on and is kept to a sentence or two; ids, states and counts are machine state and belong
 * in a shape the caller can read without parsing English.
