/**

 * ask this worker to post observations about the page it is already reading; it
 * cannot read the token, cannot reach the app on its own (the app refuses a
 * https://chatgpt.com origin), and there is no message that makes the app touch a
 * file, run a command or change a permission.
 *
 * Discovery is a scan of five fixed loopback ports for a /hello that identifies the
 * app. Nothing is broadcast and nothing listens.
 *
 * This worker also owns the observation journal. A content script lives only as long as
 * its page: a reload, a navigation or a crash takes its memory with it, and ChatGPT
 * virtualises old turns, so what is gone is often gone for good. So a content script
 * hands an observation over immediately and the durable copy lives here, in
 * chrome.storage.session — which survives this worker being shut down (Chrome does that
 * after seconds of idling) and dies with the browser, which is the right lifetime for a
 * record the app has not accepted yet.

 * browser could clear it, so the tab kept reading ChatGPT perfectly and delivered none of
 * it until the user happened to reload. That is the 2026-08-21 blackout: a live tab whose
 * request-id evidence never reached the app, so `agents action=spawn` was refused with
 * UNIDENTIFIED_CALLER while the popup showed the request id it had already read.
 *
 * A message arriving here is itself the disproof. Chrome does not deliver `runtime.sendMessage`
 * from a document that no longer exists, so an inbound message from the tab's *current*
 * document means that document is alive; a tab that really went away fails `tabs.get`, and a
 * document that really was replaced is barred by `retiredDocuments`, which this never touches.

 * names a chat the user may well be looking at right now: waking a worker would leave them
 * with the same conversation open twice, once per revival, which is exactly the pile of
 * ChatGPT tabs this whole design exists to avoid.
 *
 * So the marker is intercepted at the moment the tab is created — before it has navigated,
 * loaded ChatGPT, or run a content script — and, if that conversation is already open
 * somewhere, handed to the document that has it. Revival routing deliberately does not activate
 * or focus that existing tab: hidden/background delivery is part of the transport contract, and
 * visibility must not be required for the content document to redeem and submit the wake. The
 * empty tab the browser just made is closed again only after the existing document claims.
 *
 * A ping proves only that an existing recorder is alive. It does not prove command ownership:
 * while the service worker awaits that ping the newly opened `/c/<id>?clf=...` page can finish
 * loading and durably redeem the same command. The existing document must therefore redeem the
 * bridge lease itself and report `claimed:true` before the fallback is removed. Whichever page
 * wins that durable lease stays alive; a mere health reply can never kill the winner.
