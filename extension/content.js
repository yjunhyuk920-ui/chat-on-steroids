/**
 * What runs on the ChatGPT page.
 *
 * Three jobs. Observation never changes the conversation; presentation may replace the
 * visible live activity stream when the user has Overwrite enabled:
 *
 *  1. Observe. Messages, turn boundaries, live progress lines and visible errors are
 *     reported to the local app. Nothing is inferred that the page does not show, and
 *     a turn that stops for no visible reason is reported as exactly that.
 *
 *  2. Relabel. The app knows what every MCP tool call actually did, because it ran it.
 *     Each recorded call is matched to one "Called tool" block and given the real thing.
 *     Matching is per call and incremental: a block that cannot be matched confidently
 *     keeps ChatGPT's own label, and — this is the part that used to be wrong — it no
 *     longer suppresses the blocks around it that *can* be matched.
 *
 *  3. Offer Compact & resume, as a control beside ChatGPT's own composer buttons that
 *     says what the job is doing rather than vanishing on the next React render.
 *
 * Every selector lives in chatgpt-dom.js. This file only deals in the shapes that
 * module returns, so a ChatGPT redesign cannot reach past it.

   * Decides which recorded call belongs to which block. Pure, so it can be tested.
   *

   * `calls` is the app's recorded calls for the same turn, in the order they ran.
   * Returns `[blockIndex, call, hiddenCalls]` triples to apply.
   *
   * **A row is a group, not a call.** ChatGPT folds a run of calls into one row — observed
   * live as `4 earlier tool calls hidden` over a `collapsedSameToolCallCount: 4`, so five
   * calls behind one row. `hidden` is that count, from the page's own client state (see
   * fiberFor). It defaults to 0, which is the ordinary row and the behaviour everything had
   * before. The prop is named for a run of calls to the *same* tool and that name is not
   * reliable: the live page folded a `list_resources` call under an `agents` row. So
   * it is a count of what the row stands for and never evidence of which tools those were.
   *
   * That the row *represents* the last call of its group, not the first, is what the
   * "earlier … hidden" wording means, and it decides which call's label goes on the row.
   *
   * The rules, in the order they are tried:
   *
   *  · A block already bound to a call keeps that call, along with the `hidden` calls
   *    immediately before it — groups are contiguous in run order by construction, since
   *    ChatGPT only folds *consecutive* calls to the same tool. Labels must not move
   *    around between repaints, and a block whose call has scrolled out of the feed keeps
   *    what it has rather than being handed somebody else's.
   *  · If the unbound blocks and the unmatched calls come out even — counting each block
   *    as the `1 + hidden` calls it stands for — they pair up in order. This is the strong
   *    signal and it is what the old code required, except that the old code counted every
   *    block as one call and so fired on mismatched sets whenever anything was collapsed.
   *    That produced confidently wrong labels, which is worse than the wall of "Called
   *    tool" it replaced.
   *  · Otherwise only the blocks ChatGPT renders *identically* are matched, in order,
   *    as far as they go, and the run stops at the first folded row. That is the "wall of
   *    Called tool" case, where the page is saying nothing that could be overwritten, and
   *    where nothing has reconciled — so a fold count cannot be spent as if the calls it
   *    counts were the ones waiting in front of it. Blocks ChatGPT has named itself are
   *    left alone — and, crucially, no longer stop the rest of the turn being matched.
   *    A tie between two equally large groups is genuinely ambiguous, so nothing moves.
   *
   * Over all three, one veto: **a row never takes a call the page says it did not make.**
   * `block.tool` is the tool named by that row's own Fiber descriptor, and it is evidence
   * about that row and no other — it needs no counting, no ordering and no reconciliation
   * to be true. Every rule here is ultimately an argument from position, and position is
   * exactly what goes wrong when the recorder's view of a turn and the page's view of it
   * are not the same set of calls. Observed live on two separate chats: a row whose
   * descriptor said `screenshot` wearing a recorded `list_windows`, and a row whose
   * descriptor said `run_powershell` wearing a recorded `computer`, each one the single
   * bound row on its page and each one arrived at by a rule that "fit". A blank row is a
   * missing label; a wrong row is a lie about what this machine did.
   */
  /**
   * The app's recorded calls for one visible assistant turn.

   * long agentic turn makes that control flicker between phases. On 2026-08-23 that closed a
   * compaction turn 28 characters into its brief: the app stored `TASK`, a newline and
   * `Continue implementing ` as a whole handoff for a session holding 455 events and 318,422
   * tokens, opened the replacement chat with it, and the conversation it had just declared
   * finished went on making tool calls for another seven minutes. The replacement chat could
   * not tell that document from a complete one — no receiver can — and rebuilt the work from
   * the filesystem instead.
   *
   * So the settled answer is where this starts, not what it delivers. Four signals have to
   * agree, and hold agreeing for BRIEF_STABLE_MS, before the brief is taken to be the whole
   * brief: the stop control absent, the answer text no longer growing, the turn's tool rail
   * no longer moving, and the app reporting no local call still running.
   *
   * Every one of the first three can be fooled on its own, and the fourth is why it is here.
   * The stop control flickers between phases. The text was frozen at 28 characters for seven
   * minutes. A tool rail goes still in the gap between two calls — and stiller still *during*
   * one: a build running for three minutes renders one block that does not change a
   * character, so the whole page looks exactly like a finished turn. Only the app knows the
   * connector is still holding that call open, and it is the one participant that cannot be
   * fooled by what the page happens to be rendering.
   *
   * An unanswerable app is therefore not zero. `peekPendingTools` returns null when it could
   * not ask, and reading that as "nothing is running" is precisely the inference that lost a
   * session; it counts as busy and the watch keeps waiting. Nothing is lost by that: an app
   * that cannot be asked is an app the brief could not have been delivered to either.
   *
   * The window only ever delays a handover; it cannot produce a brief that was not written.
   * A turn that really did finish pays it once, in seconds, against a whole session.
